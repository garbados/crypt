Easy password-based encryption, by [garbados](https://garbados.github.io/my-blog/).

This library attempts to reflect [informed opinions](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html) while respecting realities like resource constraints, tech debt, and so on. The idea is to provide some very simple methods that just do the hard thing for you.

For example:

```javascript
const Crypt = require('garbados-crypt')

const crypt = new Crypt(password)
const encrypted = await crypt.encrypt('hello world')
console.log(encrypted)
> "O/z1zXHQ+..."
const decrypted = await crypt.decrypt(encrypted)
console.log(decrypted)
> "hello world"
```

Crypt only works with plaintext, so remember to use `JSON.stringify()` on objects before encryption and `JSON.parse()` after decryption. For classes and the like, you'll need to choose your own encoding / decoding approach.

## Install

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or whatever.

```bash
$ npm i -S garbados-crypt
```

## Usage

First, require the library. Then get to encrypting!

```javascript
const Crypt = require('garbados-crypt')

const crypt = new Crypt(password)
```

### new Crypt(password, [salt, [opts]])

- `password`: A string. Make sure it's good! Or not.
- `salt`: A salt, either as a byte array or a string. If omitted, a random salt is generated. *Rather than bother carrying this with you, use `crypt.export()` and `Crypt.import()` to transport your credentials!*
- `opts`: Options!
- `opts.iterations`: The number of iterations to use to hash your password via [pbkdf2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2). Defaults to 10,000.

### async Crypt.import(password, exportString) => new Crypt

Instantiates a new Crypt instance using an encoded string generated by `crypt.export()`. Use this method to import credentials generated on another device!

- `password`: A string, the same string password you used with the Crypt instance that generated the `exportString`!
- `exportString`: A string generated by `crypt.export()`.

### async crypt.export() => string

Exports a string you can use to create a new Crypt instance with `Crypt.import()`.
*Rather than bother carrying around your password and salt, use this to transport credentials across devices!*

### async crypt.encrypt(plaintext) => ciphertext

- `plaintext`: A string.
- `ciphertext`: A different, encrypted string.

### async crypt.decrypt(ciphertext) => plaintext

- `ciphertext`: An encrypted string produced by `crypt.encrypt()`.
- `plaintext`: The decrypted message as a string.

If decryption fails, for example because your password is incorrect, an error will be thrown.

### async crypt.

## Development

First, get the source:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:garbados/crypt.git garbados-crypt
$ cd garbados-crypt
$ npm i
```

Use the test suite:

```bash
$ npm test
```

The test suite includes a small benchmarking test, which runs on the server and in the browser, in case you're curious about performance.

To see test coverage:

```bash
$ npm run cov
```

## Also: How To Securely Store A Password

For a password-based encryption system, it makes sense to have a good reference on how to store passwords in a database. To this effect I have written [this gist](https://gist.github.com/garbados/29ca945d5964ef85e7936804c23edb9d#file-how_to_store_passwords-js) to demonstrate safe password obfuscation and verification. If you have any issue with the advice offered there, leave a comment!

## Why TweetNaCl.js?

This library uses [tweetnacl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl) rather than native crypto. You might have feelings about this.

I chose it because it's fast on NodeJS, bundles conveniently (33kb!), uses top-shelf algorithms, and has undergone a [reasonable audit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tweetnacl#audits).

That said, I'm open to PRs that replace it with native crypto while retaining Crypt's API.
